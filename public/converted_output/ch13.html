<h2 class="h2a" id="ch13"><a id="page_68"></a>13 Put the Pressure on Yourself</h2>
<h2 class="h2ba">The first requisite for success is the ability to apply your physical and mental energies to one problem incessantly without growing weary.</h2>
<p class="authorab">THOMAS EDISON</p>
<p class="noind">The world is full of people who are waiting for someone to come along and motivate them to be the kind of people they wish they could be. The problem is that no one is coming to the rescue.</p>
<p class="indent">These people are waiting for a bus on a street where no buses pass. If they don’t take charge of their lives and put the pressure on themselves, they can end up waiting forever. And that is what most people do.</p>
<p class="indent">Only about 2 percent of people can work entirely without supervision. We call these people “leaders.” This is the kind of person you are meant to be and that you can be, if you decide to be.</p>
<p class="indent">To reach your full potential, you must form the habit of putting the pressure on yourself and not waiting for someone else to come along and do it for you. You must choose your own frogs and then make yourself eat them in their order of importance.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_69"></a>Lead the Field</h3>
<p class="noind">See yourself as a role model. Raise the bar on yourself. The standards you set for your own work and behavior should be higher than anyone else could set for you.</p>
<p class="indent">Make a game of starting a little earlier, working a little harder, and staying a little later. Always look for ways to go the extra mile, to do more than you are paid for.</p>
<p class="indent">Your self-esteem has been defined by psychologist Nathaniel Branden as “the reputation you have with yourself.” You build up or pull down your reputation with yourself with everything you do or fail to do. The good news is that you feel better about yourself whenever you push yourself to do your best. You increase your self-esteem whenever you go beyond the point where the average person would normally quit.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Create Imaginary Deadlines</h3>
<p class="noind">One of the best ways for you to overcome procrastination and get more things done faster is by working as though you had only one day to get your most important jobs done.</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine each day that you have just received an emergency message and that you will have to leave town tomorrow for a month. If you had to leave town for a month, what would you make absolutely sure that you got done before you left? Whatever your answer, go to work on that task right now.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_70"></a>Another way to put pressure on yourself is to imagine that you just received an all-expenses-paid vacation at a beautiful resort as a prize, but you will have to leave tomorrow morning on the vacation or it will be given to someone else. What would you be determined to finish before you left so that you could take that vacation? Whatever it is, start on that one job immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">Successful people continually put the pressure on themselves to perform at high levels. Unsuccessful people have to be instructed and pressured by others.</p>
<p class="indent">By putting the pressure on yourself, you will accomplish more tasks better and faster than ever. You will become a high-performance, high-achieving personality. You will feel terrific about yourself, and bit by bit you will build the habit of rapid task completion that will then go on to serve you all the days of your life.</p>

<p class="sb-h"><strong>EAT THAT FROG!</strong></p>
<p class="noindb"><strong>1.</strong> Set deadlines and subdeadlines on every task and activity. Create your own “forcing system.” Raise the bar on yourself and don’t let yourself off the hook. Once you’ve set yourself a deadline, stick to it and even try to beat it.</p>
<p class="noind"><strong>2.</strong> Write out every step of a major job or project before you begin. Determine how many minutes and hours you will require to complete each phase. Then race against your own clock. Beat your own deadlines. Make it a game and resolve to win!</p>
