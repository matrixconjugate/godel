<p class="noindbb">Designed for individual or group play, these cards offer a fun, hands-on way to identify what’s holding you back and develop the right strategies to stop procrastinating and get more done.</p>
<p class="noindbb">One set of cards in the deck describes procrastination habits, which you rank in order of importance. Do you become paralyzed by the length of your to-do list? Do you work on simple but low-impact tasks first and neglect the harder, higher-impact tasks? Are you too easily distracted by social media?</p>
<p class="noindbb">Once you’ve ranked your negative habits, you then match these “problem” cards with “solution” cards that describe strategies for overcoming them. You’ll end up with a comprehensive, memorable, and personalized guide to dealing with your biggest behavioral obstacles to success.</p>
